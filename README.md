# Countrypedia (Vanilla JS Project)

## About

Web application that allows you to search for the country you are interested in (249 to choose from) and check information about that country, such as population, currency, top-level domain, etc.

The application also includes two filters, a search bar where you have to enter the name of the country and a little menu where after selecting a continent, only those countries that are on will be displayed.

Also added a dark mode for better UX.
